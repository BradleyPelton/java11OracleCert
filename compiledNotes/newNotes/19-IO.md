# Chapter 19 - I/O (old)
- java.io API to interact with files and streams.
- I/O streams are completely unrelated to Functional Programming streams

### Fundamental Classes/Interfaces:
- File
- InputStream         and OutputStream
- Reader              and Writer
- FileInputStream     and FileOutputStream
- BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream
- ObjectInputStream   and ObjectOutputStream
- BufferedReader      and BufferedWriter
- FileReader          and FileWriter
- PrintStream         and {}
- InputStreamReader   and OutputStreamWriter

### File System Basics
- defn: a file - record within the storage device that holds data
- defn: directory - a location that can contain files as well as other directories
- We use many of the same classes to operate on directories as files
- defn: file system - system responsible for organizing files and directories
- defn: root directory - topmost directory in the file system
- defn: path - a String representation of a file or directory within a file system
- Absolute vs relative paths

### Bytes
- Data is stored in a file system (and memory) as bits (0 or 1).
- defn: byte - set of 8 bits

### File Class
- java.io.File can represent a file or directory
- java.io.File class is one of the most commonly used class in the java.io API
- java.io.File is used to read information about existing files and directories, ls, create/delete files&directories
- An instance of a File class represents the path to a particular file or directory 
- java.io.File cannot read or write data within a file, but it can be passed as a reference to classes that can
- defn: absolute path - full path from the root directory
- defn: relative path -      path from current working directory
- `java.io.File.separator == System.getProperty("file.separator")`
- Three constructors
    1. `public File(               String pathname)`
    2. `public File(  File parent, String pathname)`
    3. `public File(String parent, String pathname)`
- java.io.File only represents a path to a file. It is not connected to an actual file 
- EXAM TRICK: `/data/zoo.txt` is not necessarily a file. directories can be misnamed with extensions to be confusing.

### File methods
- Methods
    * boolean delete()
        * Deletes the file or directory and returns true only if successful
        * if directory, directory must be empty to be deleted
    * boolean exists() - returns true if a file exists
    * String getAbsolutePath - Returns the absolute path
    * String getName() - Returns the name of the file or directory
    * String getParent()
        * Returns the parent directory that the path is contained in 
        * Returns null if root
    * boolean isDirectory() - Return true if a File object is a directory
    * boolean isFile() - Returns true if a File object is a file
    * long lastModified - Returns the number of milliseconds since the file was last modified 
    * long length() - returns the number of BYTES in the file
    * File[] listFiles() - if directory, return list of files within directory
    * boolean mkdir()
    * boolean mkdirs() - Creates the directory named by this path and any intermediate parent directories needed
    * boolean renameTo(File destination)
        * Renames the file or directory to "destination"
        * Returns true only if successful

# I/O Streams
- I/O = Input/Output

### I/O Stream fundamentals
- defn: stream - list of data elements presented sequentially
- We don't know when a stream will end
- Normal vs Buffered streams
- Writing a file one byte at a time is time consuming. The round-trip from jvm to file system is expensive.
- BufferedOutputStream groups bytes together and makes less trips
- Although commonly used with file I/O, streams are more generally used to handle reading/writing from sequential data sources.
- Submitting data to a website with an output stream and reads the results from an input stream
- Streams allow reading/writing to files that are massive (100TB) because the entire file is not loaded into memory
- Only a small "window" of a stream is visible at a time

### Byte vs Character Streams
- java.io API defines two sets of streams for reading/writing:
    1. byte streams
        * read/write binary data (0s and 1s)
        * have class names that end in `InputStream` or `OutputStream`
        * primarily used to work with binary data, such as image or executable file
    2. character streams
        * read/write text data
        * have class names that end in `Reader` or `Writer`
        * primarily used to work with text files.
        * convenience methods for working with text.
- e.g. FileInputStream vs FileReader
- Some streams don't have the word "Stream" in the name (e.g. FileInputReader). They are still I/O streams
- Byte streams can still work with text files since text is still binary.
- defn: character encoding - determines how characters are encoded and stored in bytes in a stream. (UTF-16)
- `Charset utf8Charset = Charset.forName("UTF-8");`

### Input vs Output Stream
- Most input stream classes have corresponding output stream classes
- FileInputStream vs FileOutputStream
- Most Reader classes have corresponding Writer classes.
- NOTE: `PrintWriter` has no accompanying Reader class. 
- NOTE: `PrintStream` has no accompanying InputStream class

### Low-Level vs High-Level Streams
- defn: low-level stream - connects directly with the source of the data
- Low level streams process the raw data or resource and are accessed in a direct and unfiltered manner
- FileInputStream is a low level stream that reads file data one byte at a time
- defn: high-level stream - stream built on top of another stream using wrapping
- defn: wrapping - process by which an instance is passed to the constructor of another class and operations on the resulting instance are filtered and applied to the original instance
    * example: `new BufferedReader(new FileReader("zoo.txt"))`
- Streams can be wrapped multiple times
- Outer wrapper provides new logic and reuses underlying logic
- Buffered classes should almost always be used for performance reasons. 

### Stream Base Classes
- java.io library defines four abstract classes that are the parents of all stream classes
    1. InputStream  - input  byte streams
    2. OutputStream - output byte streams
    3. Reader       - input  character streams
    4. Writer       - output character streams
- We can't instantiate these abstract classes
- Constructors of high-level streams often take a param of the base classes. 
- EXAM TRICK: Passing the wrong base class as a parameter to the constructor of high level stream
- `new BufferedInputStream(new FileReader("zoo.txt"));` // DOES NOT COMPILE

### I/O Stream Class Names
- Recapping the types of classes so far
- Properties
    * A class with "InputStream"/"OutputStream" in its name is used for reading/writing binary/byte data
    * A class with "Reader"/"Writer" in its name is used for reading/writing character or string data
    * Most, but not all, input classes have a corresponding output class
    * low-level streams connect directly with the source of the data
    * high-level streams are built on top of another stream using wrapping
    * A class with Buffered in its name reads/writes data in groups of bytes or characters 
    * With few exceptions, you only wrap a stream with another stream if they share the same abstract parent
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Common I/O Stream Operations
### Reading and Writing Data
- Both InputStream and Reader classes define `.read()` methods
- Both OutputStream and Writer classes define `.write()` methods
- .read()
    * read(int b) - read a byte at a time
    * read(byte[] b) - read multiple bytes
    * read(byte[] b, int offset, int length) - read bytes from an array from `b[offset] to b[offset + length]`
    * read(char[] c) - read multiple char
    * read(char[] c, int offset, int length) - read char from an array from `c[offset] to c[offset + length]`
- .write()
    * write(int b) - write a byte at a time
    * write(byte[] b) - write multiple bytes
    * write(byte[] b, int offset, int length) - write bytes from an array from `b[offset] to b[offset + length]`
    * write(char[] c) - write multiple char
    * write(char[] c, int offset, int length) - write char from an array from `c[offset] to c[offset + length]`
- `-1` indicates the end of a stream. 
- `while ((b = inputStream.read()) != -1) {outputStream.write(b);}`
- Most I/O streams declare a checked IOException

### Closing the stream
- All I/O streams implement Closeable
- All I/O streams include a method to release any resource within the stream
- `public void close() throws IOException`
- Resource leaks if not closed. Locked files if not closed.
- try-with-resource
- If passing streams as parameter, the method that created the stream should be the one closing it, not the inner method
- When closing a wrapped stream, calling `.close()` on the topmost object will cascade close all lower objects

### Manipulating Input Streams
- All input streams classes include methods to manipulate the order in which data is read from a stream
- `.markSupported()`
    * returns true if method `.mark()` is supported\
    * good practice to call `markSupported()` before calling mark() or reset()
- `.mark()`
    * mark the current position in the stream
- `.reset()`
    * Attempts to reset the stream to the mark()'d position
- `.skip(long n)`
    * skip the next x bytes/characters
    * basically reads data from the stream and discards the contents
- `.flush()`
    * flushes buffered data through the stream
    * requests that all accumulated data in memory be written immediately to disk
    * JVM is free to call flush whenever it wants. 
    * helps reduce data loss if application crashes
    * close() also calls flush()

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Working with I/O Stream Classes 
- The I/O stream classes include hundreds of overloaded constructors and methods

### Reading and Writing Binary Data
- Constructors
    * FileInputStream(File file)
    * FileInputStream(String name)
    * FileOutputStream(File file)
    * FileOutputStream(String name)
    * All 4 throw FileNotFoundException
- If you need to just append, FileOutputStream class includes overloaded constructor with a boolean append flag

```
try (var in = new FileInputStream(srcFile); var out = new FileOutputStream(destFile)) {
    int b;
    while((b = in.read()) != -1) out.write(b); // copy a file
}
```

### Buffering Binary Data
- Recall the poor performance of using non-buffered streams
- As high level streams, BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream that take other streams as input.
- Constructors
    * BufferedInputStream(InputStream in)
        * `new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(srcFile))`
    * BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream out)
        * `new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(destFile))`
    * NOTE: InputStream and OutputStream are abstract base classes and thus allowing many different params
- Choosing buffer size using powers of 2
- `out.write(buffer, 0, lengthRead)`
- `out.flush()`

### Reading and Writing Character Data
- `FileReader` and `FileWriter` classes, along with their associated buffer classes, are among the most convenient I/O classes
- Built-in support for text data
- Constructors
    * FileReader(File file)
    * FileReader(String name)
    * FileWriter(File file)
    * FileWriter(String name)
    * All 4 throw checked FileNotFoundException
```
try (var reader = new FileReader(srcFile); var writer = new FileWriter(destFile)) {
    int b;
    while((b = reader.read()) != -1) writer.write(b); // copy a file
}
```
- FileWriter inherits a new overloaded method: `.write(String str)` 

### Buffering Character Data
- BufferedReader and BufferedWriter 
- High-level "wrapped" buffered character streams
- constructors
    * BufferedReader(Reader in)
    * BufferedWriter(Writer out)
    * take existing Reader and Writer instances as params
- two new methods:
    * readLine()
        * returns a line as a String
        * strips out line break character
    * newLine - /n
```
try (var reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(srcFile));
    var writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(destFile))) {
        String s;
        while ((s = reader.readLine()) != null) {
            writer.write(s);
            writer.newLine();
        }
    }
```
- Reading and writing lines at a time instead of bytes
- Temporarily storing data in a String before writing.
- Checking for the end of the stream with a `null` value instead of `-1`

### Serializing Data
- defn: serialization is the process of converting an in-memory object to a byte stream
- defn: deserialization - the process of converting from a byte stream to an object.
- To serialize an object using the I/O API, the object must implement the java.io.Serializable interface
- Serializable is a "marker interface"
- defn: marker interface - an interface that does not have any methods
- Any class can implement the Serializable interface
- The purpose of implementing Serializable is to inform any process attempting to serialize the object that you built support to make the object serializable.
- defn: transient - a field that is marked transient will not be saved to a stream when the class is serialized
- e.g. making password fields transient. 
- Good practice to declare a static `serialVersionUID` variable in every class that implements Serializable
- Every time the class structure changes, `serialVersionUID` should be updated/incremented. 
- How to make a class Serializable:
    1. Class must be marked Serializable by implementing Serializable
    2. Every instance member of the class is serializable, marked transient, or has a null value at the time of serialization

### Storing data with ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream
- ObjectInputStream class is used to deserialize an object from a stream
- ObjectOutputStream is used to serialize an object to a stream
- They are both high-level streams that operate on existing streams
- Constructors
    * `ObjectInputStream(InputStream in)`
    * `ObjectOutputStream(OutputStream out)`
    * both throw IOException
- Contain a lot of methods
- Two methods need to know for the exam:
    * `.readObject()`
        - throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException`
    * `.writeObject(Object obj)`
        - throws IOException
```
// write
try (var out = new ObjectOutputStream(new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(dataFile)))) {
    for (Gorilla gorilla : gorillas) out.writeObject(gorilla);
}

// read
try (var in = new ObjectInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(dataFile)))) {
    while(true) {
        var object = in.readObject();
        if (object instanceof Gorilla) {
            gorillas.add((Gorilla) object);
        }
    }
} catch (EOFException e) {
    // file end reached
}
```
- Unlike with our readers, `-1` and `null` can't be used to denote the end of the file.
- EOFException when the end of the stream is reached

### Understanding the Deserialization Creation Process
- When you deserialize an object, the constructor of the serialized class, along with any instance initializers, is not called when the object is created.
- Java will call the no-arg constructor of the first non-serializable parent class it can find in the class hierarchy, usually Object
- ??? revisit this section

### Printing Data
- PrintStream and PrintWriter are high level output print streams classes
- Both `System.out` and `System.err` are PrintStream objects.
- Useful for writing text data to a stream.
- PrintStream and PrintWriter are the only I/O streams classes on the exam that do not have corresponding input stream classes
- PrintStream also doesn't follow the "Output in Class name" rule for OutputStreams
- Constructors:
    * `PrintStream(OutputStream out)`
    * `PrintStream(File file)`         - convenience constructor that creates the inner stream for you
    * `PrintStream(String fileName)`
    * `PrintWriter(Writer out)`
    * `PrintWriter(File file)`
    * `PrintWriter(String fileName)`
    * `PrintWriter(OutputStream out)`  - RARE EXCEPTION: mixing byte stream with character stream

### PrintStream methods
- Besides the inherited .write() methods, the print stream classes include numerous methods for writing data.
- Unlike the majority of I/O streams we've covered, these methods do not throw any Checked Exceptions
- Methods:
    * print()
        * calls `myStream.write(String.valueOf(param))` under the hood
        * numerous overloaded methods for various primitives
    * println()
        * print() + line break
    * format()
        * format(String format, Object args...)
        * format(Locale loc, String format, Object args...)
        * equivalent to `printf()`
        * %s (any type)
        * %d (int or long)
        * %f (float or double)
        * %n (inserts line break)
        * using the wrong % causes IllegalFormatConversionException
        * `System.out.format("Hello %s", "Bob")`
        * using `%5.2f` to specify format of floating points. rounding/truncating ?
    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# User input
- java.io API includes numerous classes for interacting with the user.

### Printing data to the user
- Java includes two PrintStream instance for providing information to the user: System.out and System.err
- Syntax for calling System.err is the same as System.out
- System.err is sent to a different text stream than `System.out` and often sent to different log files
- IDEs often print System.err in red

### Reading Input as a stream
- `System.in` returns an InputStream and is used to retrieve text input from the user
- `var reader = new BufferedReader(New InputStreamReader(System.in));`
- `reader.readLine()`

### Closing System Streams
- Closing System.out or System.err is not recommended
- Static Streams created by the JVM and shared everywhere
- Don't wrap in try-with-resource
- IOException thrown when attempting to operate on a closed stream.

### Acquiring Input with Console
- java.io.Console specifically designed to handle user interactions
- Console class is a singleton class (all private constructors, one factory method call)
- Only one instance of Console and it is created by the JVM. 
- `Console console = System.console();`
- methods
    * reader
        - returns Reader
        * Analogous to calling System.in
    * writer
        - returns PrintWriter
        * Analogous to calling System.out
    * format
        * convenience method for .writer().format()
        * does not support Locale overload like print stream classes
    * readLine
        * reads input until user presses the Enter key
    * readPassword
        * similar to readLine
        * returned as a char[] instead of a String
