- Streams reading material
    - Mkyong (java 8 streams filter examples)
    - Oracle.com (Processing data with Java se 8 streams, part 1)

- Optional<T>, safter alternative to using null

- HashMap::computeIfAbsent(key, val -> new ArrayList<>().add(val))

- Bitwise operators are not on the exam
- Long, Double, Integer extends Number
- Memorize boxing and unboxing syntax
- memorize default values

- condition vs expression vs statement 

- members = static fields/methods + instance fields/methods
- not members = static and instance initializers and constructors

- Inside classes, members can be defined in any order
- Inside mmbers, variables must be defined before used (forward reference)

- Variable naming rules
- any varible length
- Allowed Characters = [{A-Z},{a-z},{0-9},$,_]
- spaces and dashes are not allowed in variable names
- case sensitive variable names
- variables can start with any "allowed characters" except digits
- can't use reserved words as variables names


# var
- var = local variable type inference
- car can't be used for static or instance variables

# varargs
- main(String... args)
- varargs must be of the same type



#
- `String a =  5 + 3 "xyz" + 3 + 5` // "8xyz35"


# 
- final vs effectively final

#
- stack
- heap
- stack overflow
- out of memory
- memory heap


# 
- Nano vs Microseconds

# 
- Boxing and AutoUnboxing

#
- learn compiling and running fromn cmd
- stop depending on Maven to do everything

# SQL stored procedure
- inn -out -inout params


# Generics
- Covariance vs Contravariance

# Pass by reference vs value
- field hiding (same field)
